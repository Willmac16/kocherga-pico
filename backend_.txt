AppLocator:
read:       in identifyApplication
read:       in validateImageCRC     called by identifyApplication (twice; once to find CRC & once to compute CRC)


Bootloader:
endWrite:   in reset                if AppUpdateInProgress
endWrite:   in beginUpdate          if AppUpdateInProgress
beginWrite: in beginUpdate          unqualified, follows
write:      in handleFileReadResult if response

Overall Flow

endWrite:   in reset                if AppUpdateInProgress
AppLocator

endWrite:   in beginUpdate          if AppUpdateInProgress
beginWrite: in beginUpdate          unqualified, follows
write:      in handleFileReadResult if response

Conclusions

As the names would suggest, write operations will be bookended by beginWrite and endWrite.
Therefore, coherence between write and read can be achieved through cleaning up work in endWrite.

read should stay the same

write should place into some sort of queue/mailbox
simple solution would be to copy the cross core can implementation with flash sectors

endWrite would empty and write all remaining sectors
